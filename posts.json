    "body": "A headless CMS separates your content from its presentation. This means you can write content once and display it anywhere:\n\n- On a website\n- In a mobile app\n- On a digital billboard\n\nThe CMS provides a GUI for content creators and an API (or in this case, Git files) for developers."
